Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you ! I'm a _Full Stack Developer_ at [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/in/en)

and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My curiosity in Tech started back in my childhood by **Super Mario Bros.** (a nintendo arcade game). I was always fascinated by how things work and how they are made.

From the moment I produced **"Hello World"** in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. What started with a simple **"Hello World"** has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve privilege of working at Pragahti InfoTech. My main focus these days is building _accessible_, _inclusive products_ and _digital experiences_ in _healthcare industry_ for a variety of clients.
